                <p>I have spent over 14 years building and scaling digital products across corporate environments and startups. I have worked in high-complexity contexts, with distributed teams and ambitious objectives.</p>
                <p>I have been involved in initiatives requiring a balance between business vision, technical decisions, and coordinated execution. My role evolved from direct building to strategic definition and product leadership.</p>
                <p>My experience combines technical depth with product judgment, allowing me to operate both at the architectural level and in roadmap definition, always focused on real impact.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I have spent over 14 years creating and scaling digital products that work in the real world. I have worked with large and distributed teams, improving user experiences, reducing technical costs, and making sure things ship on time with meaning.</p>
            <p>I move comfortably between technology, product, and business. I care less about theory and more about making good decisions, simplifying complexity, and turning ideas into concrete results. I work a lot with automation and applied AI in a practical way, without fireworks.</p>
            <p>I enjoy building strong teams, helping people grow, and solving hard problems with calm, good judgment, and a focus on impact.</p>
