                <p>I have spent over 14 years building and scaling digital products across corporate environments and startups. I have worked in high-complexity contexts, with distributed teams and ambitious objectives.</p>
                <p>I have been involved in initiatives requiring a balance between business vision, technical decisions, and coordinated execution. My role evolved from direct building to strategic definition and product leadership.</p>
                <p>My experience combines technical depth with product judgment, allowing me to operate both at the architectural level and in roadmap definition, always focused on real impact.</p>

                    <h3>Direction Before Speed</h3>

            <p>On an ad honorem basis, I support founders and product professionals seeking strategic clarity.

In the future, this space may evolve into public conversations or a podcast format focused on judgment and real-world building.</p>
