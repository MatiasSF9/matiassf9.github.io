                <p>I have spent over 14 years creating and scaling digital products that work in the real world. I have worked with large and distributed teams, improving user experiences, reducing technical costs, and making sure things ship on time with meaning.</p>
                <p>I move comfortably between technology, product, and business. I care less about theory and more about making good decisions, simplifying complexity, and turning ideas into concrete results. I work a lot with automation and applied AI in a practical way, without fireworks.</p>
                <p>I enjoy building strong teams, helping people grow, and solving hard problems with calm, good judgment, and a focus on impact.</p>
